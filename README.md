# CENIPA 15 Scrapping

## Introduction

CENIPA 15 is a risk reporting form related to fauna risk in aviation. Fauna risk refers to the danger arising from the shared use of space, both on the ground and in the air, by aircraft and wildlife (including birds and other animals, both wild and domestic), which can result in damage to the aircraft.

This project is designed to collect data from the CENIPA 15 risk reporting database, persist it in a CSV file, and enable analysis in Power BI.
